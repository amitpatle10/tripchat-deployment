# TripChat Frontend — Build Guide

> **Backend:** Spring Boot at `http://localhost:8080` — see `API_CONTRACTS.md` for all endpoints
> **Goal:** A real-time group chat UI that connects to the existing backend

---

## Features (Phase 1)

- User registration and login
- View / create / join / leave groups
- Real-time group messaging via WebSocket (STOMP)
- Typing indicators & online presence
- Unread counts
- Infinite scroll message history (cursor-based, newest first)
- Optimistic message sending with clientId deduplication

---

## Principles

- **SOLID throughout.** We discuss where each principle applies as we build — especially Single Responsibility in components and the Open/Closed principle when extending state logic.
- **Test every integration immediately.** After wiring any API call or WebSocket subscription, verify it live (browser DevTools → Network / WS frames) before moving forward.
- **Component structure with intent.** Every component boundary is a deliberate decision — not just "split when it gets long." We discuss what warrants a new component, what stays co-located, and why.
- **Design patterns — name them, explain them.** Whenever we use a pattern (Container/Presenter, Compound Component, Custom Hook, Observer, Facade, etc.), call it out explicitly — why this pattern here, what problem it solves, and what the alternative would be.
- **State management deep dives.** Before adding state anywhere, explain why that layer and not the others. Tradeoffs between colocation, lifting state, and global stores matter.
- **Tradeoff analysis at every decision point.** No architectural choice is made without discussing at least two alternatives — library choices, rendering strategies, state placement, styling approaches, API patterns.
- **WebSocket lifecycle deep dives.** Before implementing any real-time feature, explain the STOMP handshake, subscription model, message routing, reconnection strategies, and how the client handles dropped connections.
- **Rendering model awareness.** Explain when a re-render occurs, what triggers it, and how to avoid unnecessary ones. We don't optimize blindly — we measure first.
- **Accessibility as a first-class concern.** For every interactive component, discuss the expected ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and focus management. Don't bolt it on at the end.
- **One topic at a time.** Never discuss multiple tools, concepts, or technologies in a single response. Finish the current discussion completely — reach a decision, get agreement — before moving to the next topic.
- **No code before discussion.** Never write or edit any code until the concept, design pattern, tradeoff, and approach have been fully discussed and agreed upon. Discussion always comes first — code follows only after understanding is clear.
- **Learn by discussion.** I present structure & tradeoffs, you decide, then we build.

## Approach

At each step:

1. **Discuss first (mandatory)** — component structure, state ownership, alternative libraries, design patterns, and tradeoffs. **No file is created or edited until this step is complete and agreed upon.**
2. **Why** — explain why this approach over alternatives, name the pattern being used
3. **Build** — small increments, commented code where the "why" isn't obvious (only after steps 1 & 2 are done)
4. **Verify** — open the browser, confirm behavior in DevTools (Network, WS, Console), test edge cases
5. **Reflect** — summarize what was learned (pattern, rendering behavior, tradeoff, or frontend concept)

Steps emerge from the conversation. We go one at a time.

**Rule:** if a file is used by only one feature → it lives inside that feature folder. If it is used by two or more features → it moves to a top-level directory.
